# Calculator, command line utility
### coded by Adam Levy

## About

This project started as a class project for Orion Lawlor's CS301 Assembly programming class in Fall 2015. 
The goal was to write a parser that would correctly parse math expressions involving plus, minus, multiplication, division, and powers (+-\*/^). 
I wrote a recursive parse function that did error checking as it went along. 
It is a bit of a beast of code chaulk full of complex flow control. But it does work reliably. 
And the principal behind its recursive operation is simple. 
Since writing the parse function I decided I wanted a useful interface for it, which offers an opportunity to learn about tty programming. 
I often do simple math on my computer from the command line using python but I thought it'd be nice to have a custom parser that had the syntax and functions I wanted. 
I've also used this project to practice and learn make. This is part of the reason I split functions into their own files.
I will soon improve the interface to allow the arrow keys for line editing and retrieving previous lines. 

## Use of this code
I publish this code in the hopes that anyone else interested in parsing expressions or tty programming or make, might learn from this code and share their successes and improvements with me. I simply ask that proper credit is attributed for use or modification of this code, and that the aspects that are original or modified are clearly represented as such in the sources. I will try to improve the code, comments, and documentation as I have time. Message me if you happen to use it and let me know what you think. Thanks!
